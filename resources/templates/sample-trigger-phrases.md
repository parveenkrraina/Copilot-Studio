## Tips for Creating Trigger Phrases

### Best Practices
1. **Include variations**: Different ways people say the same thing
2. **Use natural language**: How people actually talk
3. **Consider typos**: Common misspellings
4. **Add slang**: Informal expressions
5. **Think conversational**: Not just keywords
6. **Include questions**: People often ask questions
7. **Add commands**: Direct instructions
8. **Mix lengths**: Short and long phrases
9. **Test with users**: Real user inputs are best
10. **Review analytics**: See what users actually type

### Avoid
1. ❌ Too similar to other topics
2. ❌ Overly specific phrases that are unlikely
3. ❌ Technical jargon users might not know
4. ❌ Multiple intents in one phrase
5. ❌ Duplicate phrases across topics

### Examples of Good vs. Bad

**Good:**
- "I need help with my order" ✅
- "Track package" ✅
- "Where's my stuff?" ✅
- "Order status please" ✅

**Not Ideal:**
- "Execute order tracking subroutine" ❌ (too technical)
- "I need help tracking my order that I placed last Tuesday" ❌ (too specific)
- "Help track cancel order return refund" ❌ (multiple intents)

### Recommended Quantities
- **Simple topics**: 5-10 phrases
- **Common topics**: 10-20 phrases
- **Complex topics**: 20-30 phrases
- **High-traffic topics**: 30+ phrases

### Continuous Improvement
1. Review unrecognized user inputs weekly
2. Add successful phrases to existing topics
3. Create new topics for emerging patterns
4. Remove phrases that never trigger
5. Update based on seasonal changes

**Remember**: The more varied and natural your trigger phrases, the better your copilot will understand user intent!

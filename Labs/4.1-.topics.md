## Part 2: Implementing Conversational Nodes

### Step 4: Message Nodes - Building Welcome Flow

1. **In the Welcome Message Topic**
2. **Add Message Node**
    ```
    Welcome to TechSupport Solutions! 👋
    
    I'm here to help you with:
    • Product information
    • Technical support
    • Order status
    • Connect with an agent
    
    How can I assist you today?
    ```

### Step 5: Question Nodes - Gathering User Information

1. **In Product Inquiry Topic**
2. **Add Question Node**
    ```
    Question Type: Multiple Choice
    Question: "What type of product are you interested in?"
    
    Options:
    - Laptops
    - Smartphones
    - Accessories
    - Software
    ```

3. **Save Response to Variable**
    - Variable name: `ProductCategory`
    - This will store the user's selection

### Step 6: Condition Nodes - Creating Branched Logic

1. **Add Condition Node** after the question
2. **Configure Conditions**
    ```
    Condition 1: ProductCategory = "Laptops"
    → Action: Show laptop information
    
    Condition 2: ProductCategory = "Smartphones"
    → Action: Show smartphone information
    
    Condition 3: ProductCategory = "Accessories"
    → Action: Show accessories information
    
    Default: Show general product catalog
    ```

### Step 7: Advanced Question Types

1. **Create Order Status Topic**
2. **Add Text Input Question**
    ```
    Question: "Please provide your order number:"
    Entity: Text
    Variable: OrderNumber
    ```

3. **Add Number Input Question**
    ```
    Question: "What's your phone number for verification?"
    Entity: Number
    Variable: PhoneNumber
    ```

4. **Add Date/Time Question**
    ```
    Question: "When did you place this order?"
    Entity: Date and Time
    Variable: OrderDate
    ```

## Part 3: Advanced Conversational Patterns

### Step 8: Call Action Nodes - Power Automate Integration

1. **In Order Status Topic**
2. **Add Call Action Node**
    - Select **Create a flow** (Power Automate)
    - Flow name: `Check Order Status`
    - Input: OrderNumber (from previous question)
    - Output: OrderStatus, DeliveryDate

3. **Configure Flow Response**
    ```
    Message: "I found your order! 
    Status: {OrderStatus}
    Expected delivery: {DeliveryDate}"
    ```

### Step 9: Redirect to Topic Node

1. **Add Condition to Check Order Status**
    ```
    If OrderStatus = "Issue"
    → Redirect to "Technical Support" topic
    
    If OrderStatus = "Delivered"
    → Ask for feedback
    ```

2. **Configure Redirect**
    - Node type: **Go to another topic**
    - Select destination topic
    - Pass variables if needed

### Step 10: Variable Management

1. **Create Global Variables**
    - Customer Name
    - Customer Type (Premium/Regular)
    - Session ID

## Part 4: Error Handling and Fallback

### Step 11: Escalation to Human Agent

    OR user says "speak to human"
    ```

3. **Add Hand off Node**
    - Configure transfer to human agent
    - Include conversation context

### Step 12: Fallback Handling

1. **Create System Fallback Topic**
2. **Configure Trigger**
    - Type: **System** → **Fallback**

3. **Add Clarification Logic**
    ```

    Could you rephrase or choose from these options:"
    
    Options:
    - Product Information
    - Technical Support  
    - Order Status
    - Speak to Agent

## Part 5: Testing and Refinement

### Step 13: Test Your Chatbot

1. **Use Test Pane**
    - Click **Test your copilot**
    - Try different conversation paths
    - Verify variable passing
    - Check condition logic

2. **Test Scenarios**
    ```
    Scenario 1: Product inquiry → Laptop selection → Specifications
    Scenario 2: Technical issue → Troubleshooting → Escalation
    Scenario 3: Order status → Valid order → Feedback request
    Scenario 4: Unrecognized input → Fallback → Clarification
    ```

### Step 14: Analytics and Optimization

1. **Review Analytics**
    - Check topic performance
    - Identify drop-off points
    - Monitor escalation rates

2. **Optimize Based on Data**
    - Add missing trigger phrases
    - Improve unclear messages
    - Enhance condition logic
